# Forecast
Weather Forecast app

Steps to run the app:
 1> Check out the project from GitHub to your local system.
 2> Replace the API_KEY in gradle.properties with your own OpenWeather API key.
 3> Connect your device or start up an emulator.
 4> Run the app in debug mode build variant.

Steps to check the app:
 1> Click to open the app in your android device.
 2> Click on the floating action button to popup the dialog fragment.
 3> Mention a valid city name.
 4> Click on the save button.
 5> Click on the refresh button to call the OpenWeathermap API. 

If I had more time:
 1> Definitely I would have tried to add a lot more design.
 2> Add a few images for the weather conditions.
 3> Added new features to show day based detailed weather report.
 4> Instead of typing in the location name would have provided a screen to pinpoint the location on map or search by address.
