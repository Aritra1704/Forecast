Steps to run the app:</br>
 1> Check out the project from GitHub to your local system.</br>
 2> Replace the API_KEY in gradle.properties with your own OpenWeather API key.</br>
 3> Connect your device or start up an emulator.</br>
 4> Run the app in debug mode build variant.</br>

Steps to check the app:</br>

 3> Mention a valid city name.</br>
 4> Click on the save button.</br>

If I had more time:</br>
 1> Definitely I would have tried to add a lot more design.</br>
 2> Add a few images for the weather conditions.</br>
 3> Added new features to show day based detailed weather report.</br>
 4> Instead of typing in the location name would have provided a screen to pinpoint the location on map or search by address.</br>
